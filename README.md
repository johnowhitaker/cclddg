This is very much a work in progress. Stay tuned for better info soon :)

In the meantime, the core ideas:

- Diffusion models gradually noise an image and learn the reverse
  process. Great but lots of steps means slow inference
- DDGs tweak the training to include a discriminator, and promise good
  results in very few steps at inference
- Latent diffusion means doing it in the latent space of some
  autoencoder, which is more efficient.
- We can condition these models with various extra info. I chose to use
  CLOOB embeddings as conditioning info. That way we can get these from
  images or text or both during training, and at inference feed in
  either text or images and use them as conditioning for the generation
  process. In theory this gives a nice way to do text-to-image!

I tried training for a few hours on CC12M and while the results aren’t
photorealistic you can definitely see *something* of a prompt in the
outputs - ‘blue ocean waves’ is mostly blue, for eg. Results from a
longer trainging run soon.

## Install

I might turn this into a package later, for now your best bet is to
check out the colab(s) below or follow the instructions in ‘Running the
training script’.

## What is all this

The main thing this code does is define a UNet architecture and an
accompanying Discriminator architecture that can take in an image (or a
latent representation of one) along with conditioning information (what
timestep we’re looking at, a CLOOB embedding of an image or caption) and
a latent variable `z` used to turn the unet into a more GAN-like
multimodal generator thingee.

# Running the training script

The train script is written to run OUTSIDE this directory (aka NOT in
cclddg). It also assumes the locations of various dependancies and model
files. To set it up, in a notebook run:

``` python
# !git clone https://github.com/johnowhitaker/cclddg                               &>> install.log
# !git clone https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion                           &>> install.log
# !git clone https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers                        &>> install.log
# !pip install -e ./taming-transformers                                            &>> install.log
# !git clone --recursive https://github.com/crowsonkb/cloob-training               &>> install.log
# !git clone https://github.com/openai/CLIP/                                       &>> install.log
# !pip install CLIP/.                                                              &>> install.log
# !pip install --upgrade webdataset ipywidgets lpips                               &>> install.log
# !pip install datasets omegaconf einops wandb pytorch_lightning                   &>> install.log
# !wget https://ommer-lab.com/files/latent-diffusion/kl-f8.zip                     &>> install.log
# !unzip -q kl-f8.zip
```

Then if you wish to use W&B for logging, run `wandb login` in a
terminal.

Then copy the script from the cclddg folder downloaded as part of the
command above to your local dir:

`cp cclddg/train_cclddg.py train.py`

And run your training like so:

`python train.py --z_dim 16 --n_channels_unet 64 --batch_size 64 --n_batches 200 --lr_gen 0.0001 --lr_disc 0.0001 --log_images_every 50 --save_models_every 500 --n_steps 8 --dataset celebA --wandb_project cclddg_faces`
