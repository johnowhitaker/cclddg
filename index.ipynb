    "\n",
    "- Diffusion models gradually noise an image and learn the reverse process. Great but lots of steps means slow inference\n",
    "- DDGs tweak the training to include a discriminator, and promise good results in very few steps at inference\n",
    "- Latent diffusion means doing it in the latent space of some autoencoder, which is more efficient.\n",
    "- We can condition these models with various extra info. I chose to use CLOOB embeddings as conditioning info. That way we can get these from images or text or both during training, and at inference feed in either text or images and use them as conditioning for the generation process. In theory this gives a nice way to do text-to-image!\n",
